    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This ground beef and cabbage recipe was my mother's. She was a country cook, plain and simple. But as I have traveled and worked and experienced foods from around the world, I look back and realize that many of the dishes she prepared, while simple, were perfect for that moment. Sometimes we have to put emotion and love in a dish to make it extra-special. Serve with corn on the cob and cornbread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
